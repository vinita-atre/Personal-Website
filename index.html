This was combined with a population or census dataset like <a href ="https://www.census.gov/popest/data/datasets.html">United States Census Board</a> to get population distribution or density across the regions and the ratio of males to females as well as age group. </p>

                									<p><b>Understanding the user</b></p>

                									<p>In this stage, I used brainstorming to come up with the various interesting paarmeters that would help triangulate and study earthquakes. Also I wanted to add visualization to show the damage that the earthquake had caused which would help in mitigaion.</p>

                										<h3>Design Phase - Defining User Interactions</h3>
                										<p><b>Overview</b><br/>
                											The interface will contain a map view in the centre part and a parameter control panel at the right side.  The map can be a 2D or a 3D view which is adjustable using a toggle switch like a radio button. It allows for gesture support like double tap to zoom, pinch to zoom and scrolling in 2D. It also allows for rotation in 3D mode. The map uses color gradient to show the topography and elevation. Also hovering the mouse on the point of impact in the 2D view will show the depth of the earthquake as a pop up.</p>

                											<p><b>Filters and Control Panel</b><br />
                												The control panel lets one apply filters to find earthquakes of a certain magnitude or at certain depth or during a certain time or in a certain continent or in a certain topography (basically land or water or a certain elevation) or in regions of certain population density or earthquakes with certain amount of fatality. 
                												On a default setting, a time lapse of earthquakes over the past ten years will be displayed on the map. The area of impact will be shown as a circle over the surface in a bright color. The gradient of the color used will also indicate the magnitude of the earthquake. The current time will be shown in a region above the map</p>

                												<p><b>User events</b><br /></p>
                												<ul><li><p>When a person single clicks on a certain earthquake site then the time lapse will stop. A small time lapse for the individual earthquake will be shown. The centre point will be shown as a blinking point with frequency equal to the frequencies of the primary, secondary and surface waves as the earthquake progresses.</p></li>

                										<p>I am the project owner/user experience individual for company A. I need to build (visually) an experience to get users sign-up and attend the Washington Wizards game night on Oct 31, 2016 to increase revenue.</p>
                										&nbsp;

                										<p><b>Understanding the user</b></p>

                										<p>I did initial research through basketball blogs, previous game videos, basketball news, Washington wizards blogs and new, twitter and Facebook page for Washington wizards to understand the target user . This also helped me to understand the culture and needs of the typical basketball game enthusiast. I created two personas: Primary and Secondary</p>

He used to play basketball as a kid and now wants to engage his kid into the game too. John is not very tech savvy but uses social media and smartphones. John hates being overwhelmed with too much data. He has high emotional connectivity with basketball.</p>

He also thinks of game events as a way to socialize and to hangout with his friends. Since he is a student, he is also more interested in offers and sales on game tickets. He is always on the go and needs a portable solution. He has a short attention span and get easily distracted by ads and secondary content on the websites.</p>

                										&nbsp;

                										<p>Since anyone with a email ID can sign up for the game and there is no age restriction, the payment screen is different for people above 18 years and others. Users above 18 years can enter their card details to make the online payment. However users under 18 year must defer the responsibility of payment to an adult.</p>
                										&nbsp;

                										<p>After payment completing the payment, the user get an electronic ticket which he can email to himself or print. The user constantly sees system status and where they are in the signup process. There is also a close button which is clearly visible if the user wishes to exit.</p>

                							&nbsp;

                							<p><b>Understanding the Business needs</b></p>

                							<p>The app needs to create a more accessible mobile application for visually impaired people.</p>
                							&nbsp;

                							<p><b>Understanding the user</b></p>

                							<p>In order to create a recipe experience for visually impaired as well as normal users, I needed to come up with a common way of interaction. I performed initial research on app usage by studying the voice over feature in iphones to understand how the visually impaired people use their phones and applications.<br />
                								I also studied how they navigate and interact using various gestures. I went through blogs and YouTube videos of blind people cooking. This helped me analyse the challenges that people with visual impairment face.</p>
                								<br />
                								<img src="img/portfolio/AudioRecipeBook/Userproblems.png" style="width:100%" />
                								<p><b>Findings: </b>A few of the findings included that they is a lack of conversational interfaces, better navigation and interactivity.<br />
                									I also wanted to take into consideration the environment of usage. A recipe app can be used while cooking or it can be used to just read and understand the recipe. Hence I concluded that a dual mode recipe app with hands-free mode and normal usage mode is required. The app will not have an audio output but one can talk back to the application. The application is tab based so as to have easy navigation and semantic control over content.</p>

                										<p>Information architecture considerations have led me to a 3 screen design with a home page, tabular stats comparison page, graphical stats comparison page.<br />
                											The Home explains the problem by displaying the crucial factors for the college and the dropout trend. The Stats comparator page gives user the choice to compare the cause factors of College X with any other college for the current year in a tabular fashion. The Graph page provides a graphical comparison of trends for the cause factors over time.<br/>
                											Material colors are chosen with care to draw attention to certain UI elements or parts of the screen</p>

                											<p>The thinker-collaborative type dashboard consists of 3 screens which are Home page, Comparison Graphs page, and Generate Report Page. The Home explains the problem by displaying the crucial factors for the college and the dropout trend. It allows user input for probable causes. The Comparison Graphs page shows the data form the cause factors in graphs. The dropout trend over time is presented as an overlay at the bottom at all times. This allows easy comparing and as well as cause-effect analysis. To allow collaboration, the Generate Reports page provide a checklist of items to be added to the report along with section for comments which can then be sent to the right people by just using their names.</p>

                				<hr class="star-primary" /><img alt="" class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/AirLight/logo.jpg" style="width: 75%" />
                				<p>Conducted user tweet analysis to define problem statement and create wireframes for the mobile solution</p>


                				<p><b>Scenario: </b> Air travel is preferred by people when they value their time over money or in cases where no other means is available. With increasing number of airlines, old ones expanding coming up as well as more and more routes being added, the airports become the bottleneck of all traffic. As per the TSA blog, in 2016, the number of air passengers is estimated to increase by 15% whereas there is a 10% drop in the agents at the TSA as per the agency which is a part of the homeland security.</p>
                				&nbsp;

                				<p><b>Understanding the user and environment</b></p>

                				<p>I started by studying the current motivations and solutions proposed to provide a better experience to the air passengers. Some solutions involved increasing the airport officials, stations and equipment at the airport. The shortcoming of this solution is that it would require training time and expensive infrastructure equipment.<br/>
                				The current technology is less engaging an user-friendly. There a few websites and mobile apps to help passengers to navigate the airport and use the various services at the airport but their usage is localized and the apps in themselves are not integrated with the essential services.</p>

                				<p><b>User Tweet Qualitative analysis</b> I also wanted to understand the situation from the passengers&#39; point of view. So I conducted qualitative twitter sentiment analysis to highlight the main areas of concerns for the air passengers. My key findings were as follows:</p>

                													<ul>
                														<li>
                															<p id="list-item">Lack of organisation on the airport</p>

                														<p>The home screen starts with a prompt to get ready for the airport experience. The home screen is the guide screen throughout the app which will let user know what to do next. The side drawer provides easy navigation to the important features of the app and can be accessed from any screen.</p>
                														<img id="wireframe-images" src="img\portfolio\AirLight\wireframe\wireframe-2.jpg" width="70%" />
                														<p>The ticket is shown along with a scan able code to log the passenger into the airport system. The user will get various announcements as notifications which they can easily read or hear any number of times as per their convenience.</p>
                														<img id="wireframe-images" src="img\portfolio\AirLight\wireframe\wireframe-3.jpg" width="70%" />
                														<p>The user can easily view their location on the airport map and navigate without issues. The user gets to see the various security protocols that they need to follow which hastens the security checking process</p>
                														<img id="wireframe-images" src="img\portfolio\AirLight\wireframe\boardingpass.png" />
                				<p>Simple and minimalistic design for fast and efficient use.</p>
                			   

               					 &nbsp;
                				<p><b>AR perspective</b></p>

                				<p>Wearables like smartwatches and google glass will be interesting for the project AirLight. This will provide easy access to the app without placing extra burden on the user. Overlaying information over the real world provides more meaningful contextual information.</p>

                				<p><b>Dual Task Problem</b></p>

                				<p>Using the smartphone while navigating in an airport environment will introduce the dual task problem. To solve this problem, we can look at a more AR ready app with haptic, video and audio feedback in real time would be less intrusive and more immersive. I think that wearable technologies will help us get to that point to create an AR solution.</p>

                															&nbsp;

                										<h3>Scenario</h3>

                										<p>The interface being tested is irctc.co.in which is the official website of Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Limited. It is used for booking railway tickets, checking the statuses of trains, finding trains specific for user need, checking the ticket reservation status, finding out catering options during the train journey. One can also book flight tickets. Apart from this, it also has a tourism section which provides various attractions that are available throughout India. There is provision to book hotels and other accommodation throughout India. The usability test aims to test these basic features about the website on a desktop environment. The test also aims to check usability of the help and support information provided.</p>

                										<h3>Methodology</h3>

                										<p><b>Subject</b></p>

                										<p>The usability study involved three user subjects one for each usability methodology namely the silent observer, the think aloud and the constructive interaction. The helper for the constructive interaction method was a member of the evaluation team. The three subjects were in the age range of 18-28 years with expert level of expertise with computers and technology. The users also were moderately frequent travellers and were proficient in using travel websites.</p><br>
                										<p><b>Environment</b></p>

                										<p>The interface was tested on a desktop platform in indoor settings. </p><br>
                										<p><b>Pre-Test questionnaire</b></p>

                										<p>The questionnaire started with age bracket question to understand the basic trend of user age on usage of travel interface and technology in general. Also payment becomes an issue if a user is under 18 years. Experience with computers was asked to determine if it can cause any problems in using the interface being tested. Travel information is asked to know if the people are familiar with other travel websites and if they have interest or motivation in using the travel websites. The questionnaire also tries to know about user habit of using tutorials when they face problem with a website. Lastly we try to accommodate and understand any special needs that a user may have which may affect the results of the usability study.</p><br>
                										<p><b>Task description</b></p>

                										<p>The tasks were designed to accomplish the basic functions that a user may perform with the travel interface. The task cover different functionalities present in different section of the website.  </p>
                										<br>
                										<p>The table represents the task and number of users who finished or failed the tasks.</p>
                										<img src="img/portfolio/TravelWebsite/tasktable.png"><br>
                										<p><b>Post-test questionnaire</b></p>
                										<p>The questionnaire was aimed to get as much review and feedback from the user as possible about the interface. A multiple choice question format on the scale of 1-10 was adopted to provide an easy to answer way without burdening the user too much. A general mid or neutral number was also provided. A comment section was also provided at the end of each multiple choice question. The questions asked the user about the level of difficulty/ease with the system. It also asked about the terminologies used on the system, navigation used on the system, as well as their learning experience with the system. The feedback mechanism and error prevention mechanisms were also under scrutiny by the user. Also, it asked users about how many tasks were they able to perform and whether the system relied on them to remember a lot of data as well page structure to accomplish these tasks. Lastly, users were asked to comment and rate the error recovery and correction provided by the interface.</p><br>
