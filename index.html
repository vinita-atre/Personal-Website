                										<h3>Discover Phase - User, Business &amp; Environment</h3>
                										<i>Created using Powerpoint</i>

                										<p><b>Understanding the Business needs</b></p>

                										<p>I am the project owner/user experience individual for company A. I need to build (visually) an experience to get users sign-up and attend the Washington Wizards game night on Oct 31, 2016 to increase revenue.</p>
                										&nbsp;

                										<p><b>Understanding the user</b></p>

                										<p>I did initial research through basketball blogs, previous game videos, basketball news, Washington wizards blogs and new, twitter and Facebook page for Washington wizards to understand the target user . This also helped me to understand the culture and needs of the typical basketball game enthusiast. I created two personas: Primary and Secondary</p>
                										&nbsp;

                										</div>

                										<p><b>Primary Persona: </b>My primary persona is John. John is a hardworking and sincere school teacher in middle school. He used to play basketball as a kid and now wants to engage his kid into the game too. John is not very tech savvy but uses social media and smartphones. John hates being overwhelmed with too much data. He has high emotional connectivity with basketball.</p>
                										&nbsp;

                										</div>

                										<p><b>Secondary Persona: </b>My secondary persona is James. James is a high school student who occasionally plays but prefers to follow the basketball game news. He also thinks of game events as a way to socialize and to hangout with his friends. Since he is a student, he is also more interested in offers and sales on game tickets. He is always on the go and needs a portable solution. He has a short attention span and get easily distracted by ads and secondary content on the websites.</p>
                										&nbsp;

                										<h3>Define Phase - Defining the problem</h3>
                										<i>Created using thinking by analyzing user goals, business goals and environment</i>

                										<p>How can we get people to sign up and attend the Washington Wizards game on 31st October 2016 to support the team, increase fan base and generate revenue ?</p>
                										&nbsp;

                										<h3>Design Phase - Creating Wireframes</h3>
                										<i>Created using LucidCharts</i>

                										<p>I wanted to keep the user flow is simplistic and fast in order to prevent distractions to the user in their primary task of signing up for the game.</p>

                										</div>

                										<p>The home screen is information with repetitive call for actions on the page to get users to actually sign up. The registration page is minimalist and even has social media authentication options.</p>
                										&nbsp;

                										<p>Since anyone with a email ID can sign up for the game and there is no age restriction, the payment screen is different for people above 18 years and others. Users above 18 years can enter their card details to make the online payment. However users under 18 year must defer the responsibility of payment to an adult.</p>
                										&nbsp;

                										<p>After payment completing the payment, the user get an electronic ticket which he can email to himself or print. The user constantly sees system status and where they are in the signup process. There is also a close button which is clearly visible if the user wishes to exit.</p>
                										&nbsp;

                										&nbsp;

                										<p><b>Information Architecture</b><br />
                											I designed 5 screen design with a home page and 4 signup process pages. The signup process has registration page, choose a seat page, make payment page and get ticket page.</p>

                											<p><b>Navigation</b><br />
                												Process has a step indicator on each page to show the current progress. The Home page is used to draw user attention and get them excited about the content by showing Viral content and news, exclusive goodies, event information, carousel with multimedia.</p>

                												<p><b>Scalability</b><br />
                													The design is responsive and scalable to any device be it a desktop, laptop, tablet or cell phone.</p>

                							<h3>Discover Phase</h3>

                							<p><b>Scenario:</b> Cooking is an important part of everyone&#39;s life. This includes actually accessing a recipe to cook and even having ingredient shopping list ready when the user is in the market.</p>
                							&nbsp;

                							<p><b>Understanding the Business needs</b></p>

                							<p>The app needs to create a more accessible mobile application for visually impaired people.</p>
                							&nbsp;

                							<p><b>Understanding the user</b></p>

                							<p>In order to create a recipe experience for visually impaired as well as normal users, I needed to come up with a common way of interaction. I performed initial research on app usage by studying the voice over feature in iphones to understand how the visually impaired people use their phones and applications.<br />
                								I also studied how they navigate and interact using various gestures. I went through blogs and YouTube videos of blind people cooking. This helped me analyse the challenges that people with visual impairment face.</p>
                								<br />
                								<img src="img/portfolio/AudioRecipeBook/Userproblems.png" style="width:100%" />
                								<p><b>Findings: </b>A few of the findings included that they is a lack of conversational interfaces, better navigation and interactivity.<br />
                									I also wanted to take into consideration the environment of usage. A recipe app can be used while cooking or it can be used to just read and understand the recipe. Hence I concluded that a dual mode recipe app with hands-free mode and normal usage mode is required. The app will not have an audio output but one can talk back to the application. The application is tab based so as to have easy navigation and semantic control over content.</p>

The Home explains the problem by displaying the crucial factors for the college and the dropout trend. It allows user input for probable causes. The Comparison Graphs page shows the data form the cause factors in graphs. The dropout trend over time is presented as an overlay at the bottom at all times. This allows easy comparing and as well as cause-effect analysis. To allow collaboration, the Generate Reports page provide a checklist of items to be added to the report along with section for comments which can then be sent to the right people by just using their names.</p>

                				<p id="left_p"> Air travel is preferred by people when they value their time over money or in cases where no other means is available. With <mark>increasing number of airlines and existing ones expanding by coming up with more routes being added, the airports become the bottleneck of all traffic.</mark> As per the TSA blog, in 2016, the number of air passengers is estimated to increase by 15% whereas there is a 10% drop in the agents at the TSA as per the agency which is a part of the homeland security.</p>

                										<h3>Scenario</h3>

                										<p>The interface being tested is irctc.co.in which is the official website of Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Limited. It is used for booking railway tickets, checking the statuses of trains, finding trains specific for user need, checking the ticket reservation status, finding out catering options during the train journey. One can also book flight tickets. Apart from this, it also has a tourism section which provides various attractions that are available throughout India. There is provision to book hotels and other accommodation throughout India. The usability test aims to test these basic features about the website on a desktop environment. The test also aims to check usability of the help and support information provided.</p>

                										<h3>Methodology</h3>

                										<p><b>Subject</b></p>

                										<p>The usability study involved three user subjects one for each usability methodology namely the silent observer, the think aloud and the constructive interaction. The helper for the constructive interaction method was a member of the evaluation team. The three subjects were in the age range of 18-28 years with expert level of expertise with computers and technology. The users also were moderately frequent travellers and were proficient in using travel websites.</p><br>
                										<p><b>Environment</b></p>

                										<p>The interface was tested on a desktop platform in indoor settings. </p><br>
                										<p><b>Pre-Test questionnaire</b></p>

                										<p>The questionnaire started with age bracket question to understand the basic trend of user age on usage of travel interface and technology in general. Also payment becomes an issue if a user is under 18 years. Experience with computers was asked to determine if it can cause any problems in using the interface being tested. Travel information is asked to know if the people are familiar with other travel websites and if they have interest or motivation in using the travel websites. The questionnaire also tries to know about user habit of using tutorials when they face problem with a website. Lastly we try to accommodate and understand any special needs that a user may have which may affect the results of the usability study.</p><br>
                										<p><b>Task description</b></p>

                										<p>The tasks were designed to accomplish the basic functions that a user may perform with the travel interface. The task cover different functionalities present in different section of the website.  </p>
                										<br>
                										<p>The table represents the task and number of users who finished or failed the tasks.</p>
                										<img src="img/portfolio/TravelWebsite/tasktable.png"><br>
                										<p><b>Post-test questionnaire</b></p>
                										<p>The questionnaire was aimed to get as much review and feedback from the user as possible about the interface. A multiple choice question format on the scale of 1-10 was adopted to provide an easy to answer way without burdening the user too much. A general mid or neutral number was also provided. A comment section was also provided at the end of each multiple choice question. The questions asked the user about the level of difficulty/ease with the system. It also asked about the terminologies used on the system, navigation used on the system, as well as their learning experience with the system. The feedback mechanism and error prevention mechanisms were also under scrutiny by the user. Also, it asked users about how many tasks were they able to perform and whether the system relied on them to remember a lot of data as well page structure to accomplish these tasks. Lastly, users were asked to comment and rate the error recovery and correction provided by the interface.</p><br>

Do not frame the error messages from a system point of view but rather frame them from a user point of view. Also guide the user to the corrective steps that they may need to perform.</p>
